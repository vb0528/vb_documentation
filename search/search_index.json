To achieve this we had done the following things: 1.)Identied the colour of 12 packages, on shelf using Camera#1. Using QR decoding and the updated the Inventory management spreadsheet of the wharehouse using ROS-IOT BRIDGE 2.)Then to recieve the incomming orders published on topic \"/eyrc/vb/JaiMataD/orders\" we used our ros iot bridge and subscribed to it for getting orders 3.) After recieving orders ur5_1 arm picks the desired package from the shelf according to ine incoming order ie (medcines food or clothes) and place it on the conveyor belt 4.) After placing the box on conveyor the orders dispatched sheet in the IMS spreadsheet is updated via ros-iot-bridge and an email alert regarding dispatched order is send to the desired email id (usig g-script) 5.) While dispatching a costuom message is published bt node_t5_ur5_1 which contains the detected color and othe details of the package dispatched 6.) When package reaches ur5_2 arm it is detected by the logical camera 2 and the sorted into different colored bins by the ur5_2 arm with the help or color message that was published by ur5_1 node 7.) When pkg is dropped in the sorting bin the order shipped sheet of IMS spreadsheet is updated and another email alert is sent to the desired email id regarding shipped item Task-5 Video link: To watch simulation of task 5 click here . Implementation To implement this task we have created 2 nodes ( node_t5_ur5_1 and node_t5_ur5_2 ) to control both the ur5 arms seperately and another pkg ie Ros-Iot-Bridge to handle all commumication between ros and iot server and spread sheets pkg_task5: This is the main package for task 5 which contains all scripts, launch file , config files and saved bag files required for this task. SCRIPTS: There are 2 scripts node_t5_ur5_1.py and node_t5_ur5_2.py for different ur5 arms node_t5_ur5_1.py: this node controls ur5_1 arm which is near thhe shelf and is used to pic and place boxes from shelf on to the conveyor belt in this node first we have subscribed to the 2d camera which gives the imaage feed of the shelf . using pyzbar , cv2 library we have detected all 12 pkgs on shelf with their colors and stored the data in list (cotaining list of color , and position on shelf ) then we have seperated all the differnt color pkgs in different lists and while doing so we have also updated our inventory managemant spreadsheet usnng ros iot bridge after which we have subscribed for the incomming messages, when the message is recieved it is published in the incomming orders spread sheet and the ur5_1 starts moving to pick and place the box once the box is placed on the conveyor the dispatched order spread sheet is updated via ros--iot-bridge and email notification is sent to user and the color of the box along with other order details is published on a costom topic which will be subscribed bt the node_t5_ur5_2 for sorting the pkg if multiple orders are comming at same time then the orders are processed in the order of priority ie meds first then food and then clothes this is attained by sorting the incommngi order based on order is as the order id for differnt priority orders is differnt Class methods and functions: This script is used to control ur5_1 arm and read incoming orders and process them according to the inventory and control 2D cam which detects all the packages in the shelf with their colour and relative position in the shelf. Following are the functions defined in script and their description: 1- conveyer_state_callback: This function is used to check conveyer state and used by callback function. 2-callback_logical_cam_1: This is logical camera 1 callback function and used to check available package under camera. 3- conveyer: This is used to start/stop the conveyer. 4- clear_octomap: This function clears octomap of sensors docstrings and does nothing really. 5-set_joint_angles: This function is used to set joint angles. 6- hard_set_joint_angles: This function is used to forcefully set joint angles. 7- get_qr_data: This function is used to decode QR code present on boxes. 8- moveit_play_planned_path_from_file: It is used to play trajectory saved in yaml file. 9-moveit_hard_play_planned_path_from_file: This function is used to forcefully play path from yaml file. 10-image_conversion: This function is used to convert incoming image messages to cv2 images and take threshold to detect all packages. 11- attach_box: This function is used to attach box to ur5 arm in gazebo as well as in rviz. 12- detach_box: This function is used to detach box frim ur5 arm in gazebo as well as rviz. 13-send_goal_iot: This function is used to publish message on MQTT topic. 14- on_transition: This function is used by send goal iot as callback. 15-callback_orders: This function is used to receive incoming orders and publish them in spread sheet using ros_iot_bridge. 16-proceed: This function is used for pick place action for dispatching orders. 17-get_time_str: This function is used to get dispatch time in string format. 18-_del_: This function is used to delete class object. 19-main: This is the main function. It first captures image from 2D camera and gets all packages on shelf and push all packages on IMS spreadsheet and used to process incoming orders. node_t5_ur5_2 : this node is used to control the ur5_2 arm and sort the pkgs into correct color bin this is achieved by subscrbing to the logical camera 2 which detets the incomming pkg on the coneyor and when pkg reaches certain position under the cam the cnveyr belt is stopped and the box is attached to the arm and by subscribing to the custom topic published in node_t5_ur5_1 containing color and other details the package is sorted into sorting bins when the pkg is dropped in the bin the order shipped sheet of IMS spreadsheet is updated and another email notificaton is sent to the user regarding shipped order using ros-iot-bridge Class methods and functions: This script is used to control ur5_2 arm and sort all the packages dispatched by ur5_1 arm using the color published by ur5_1 node while dispatching the package. It also, with the help of logical camera 2, detects the package and stopping the conveyer so that the ur5_2 arm can reach the package and sort it in corresponding bins. Following are the functions defined in script and their description: 1- conveyer_state_callback: This function is used to check conveyer state and used by callback function. 2-callback_color: This function is used to save incoming color messages published by ur5_1 node whilw dispatching the order/packages. 3-callback_logical_cam_2: This function is used to check available packages under camera and to sort available packages according to the incoming orders. 4-clear_octomap: This function is used just to clear the octomap of sensors docstrings. 5- conveyer: This function is used to start/stop the conveyor. 6-attach_box: This function is used to attach box to ur5 arm in gazebo as well as rviz. 7- detach_box: This function is used to detach box from ur5 arm in gazebo as well as rviz. 8-set joint angles: This function is used to set joint angles. 9- hard_set joint angles: This function is used to forcefully set joint angles. 10- moveit_play_planned_path_from_file: It is used to play trajectory saved in yaml file. 11-moveit_hard_play_planned_path_from_file: This function is used to forcefully play path from yaml file. 12-send_goal_iot: This function is used to publish message on MQTT topic. 13- on_transition: This function is used by send goal iot as callback. 14-get_time_str: This function is used to get shipped time in string format. 15-get_Estimated_Delivery_date: This function is used to get delivery time in string format. 16-_del_: This function is used to delete class object. 17-main: This is the main function. Here, class object is created for ur5_2 arm and logical cam2 subscriber is called. Launch Files: task5_solution.launch This launch file that launches all nessary nodes and simulation environment ie gazebo, rviz planning scene and all nessary nodes used to complete this task pkg_ros_iot_bridge: This package consist a action server node_action_server_ros_iot_bridge.py which accepts Goals from Action Clients. On receiving appropriate Goal the Action Server, is able to push data on spreadsheet and is able to subscribe to any MQTT Topic and publish the message from MQTT subscription to a ROS Topic /ros_iot_bridge/mqtt/sub using msgMqttSub.msg message file. /eyrc/vb/JaiMataD/orders: this topic is used for listening to incomming orders /eyrc/JaiMataD/ros_to_iot : Use this MQTT Topic to publish data from ROS Node.
